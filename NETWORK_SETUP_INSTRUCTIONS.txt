# After cloning, run this to set up network (one time only):
# sudo ./setup-network.sh

# Then for Pi Zero, set your WiFi SSID:
# nmcli connection modify wlan0-static 802-11-wireless.ssid "YOUR_SSID"
# nmcli connection modify wlan0-static wifi-sec.psk "YOUR_PASSWORD"

# That's it. Never touch the network config scripts again.
